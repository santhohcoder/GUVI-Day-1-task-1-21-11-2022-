Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
 
  Intailly HTTP was used as an communication channel between the server and the client. The first version HTTP 0.9 was introduced in early 90's, its scope 
  was very limited. All the datas were transmitted only via ASCII  and the only possibe operation was the GET command.
  Later a new version 1.0 was introduced in the year 1996, whivh hd some improvements over the old version.
  Then came the version 1.1 in the next yes itself the following are tyhe features of it..

  1. From the intial 3 method(GET,POST,HEAD)to several new methods such as PUT, PATCH,DELETE,CONNECT, etc were introduced.
  2. From the header section to an Host Header Section introduced., which is specifically important to route message through proxy servers
  3.Server request can be processed from an single connection itseflf instead of requiring separate connection.
  4.Till date all of them mostly use this only.


  Then came the version 2.0 after 18 years(2015) which had several features like
  1. Instead of giving each time request  , it moved closer of providing an multiple request at a time, so it wil work asymmentrically.
  2. Introduced with an option of prioritising the request based on  our needs.
  3. Easy and automatic compression of the files to ZIP files format to save space and time
  4. Easy connection reset option was also introduced.
  5.Server push: to avoid a server receiving lots of requests, HTTP 2.0 introduced a server push functionality.
   With that, the server tries to predict the resources that will be requested soon. So, the server proactively pushes these resources to the client cache

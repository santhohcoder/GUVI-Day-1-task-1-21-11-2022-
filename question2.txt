Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript??

Objects in javascript can be called as the combination of several primitive data type {number, String,integer..etc}and the referance data types {the object itself}
To  Note the Object is always an referance data type only., which means that each time when we create an object an particular memory is alloted to it anf
when we want to modify or refer we access it by the referance of the memory location.
The NEW keyword is use to create an object
The properties of an object can be referred using .(dot) operation.
The object might contain several attributes whcih might be of any data type..

For example we can create an object car with its attributes as given below..
  var mycar=new Object()
  mycar.name="ferari"
  mycar.make="India"
  mycar['name']="noname"

  The object attributes are represented within array brackets if the attributes are of string type but starting with any special characters..
  Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. 
  You can define a property by assigning it a value.


  One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal
   simply define the property and values inside curly braces as shown below

                  let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};
